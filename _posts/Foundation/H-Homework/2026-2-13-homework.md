## Learning Summary
Here’s what I learned from team teaches:

- Strings (P2): Strings are sequences of characters used to store and manipulate text in JavaScript.

- Mathematical Expressions (P2): These use operators like +, -, *, /, and % to perform calculations and evaluate numeric results.

- Booleans (P2): Booleans represent true or false values and are often used in comparisons and decision-making.

- JSON and JavaScript Objects (P2): Objects store data in key-value pairs, and JSON is a text format used to store and transfer structured data.

- Nested Conditionals (P2): These are if statements inside other if statements, allowing more complex decision-making.

- Iterations (P2): Iterations use loops (like for or while) to repeat code multiple times.

- Data Abstraction (P2): Data abstraction organizes and simplifies complex data, often using functions or objects to make code cleaner and reusable.

- Arrays (P2): Arrays store multiple values in a single variable and allow you to access them by index.
